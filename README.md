## Assignment 1: Simple Calculator in Assembly

### Requirements:

* Implement a simple calculator program in assembly language that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
* Take user input for two operands and the desired operation.
* Display the result of the calculation.
* Implement error handling for invalid input.

### Restrictions:

* Use only basic arithmetic instructions available in the chosen assembly language.
* Avoid using high-level constructs; stick to low-level operations.
* Minimize the use of external libraries or system calls.

### Submission Guidelines:

* Submit the assembly source code along with any necessary files for building and running the program.
* Include a README file explaining how to assemble and run the calculator program.
* Provide a brief report discussing the challenges faced during implementation and how they were addressed.
